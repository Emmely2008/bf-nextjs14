# Setting Up a Next.js Project

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a new Next.js 14 project.

## 1. Setting Up Your Development Environment

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. Next.js 14 requires Node.js 12.22.0 or later. You can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

- **Package Manager**: You can use either npm (which comes with Node.js) or Yarn. If you prefer Yarn and haven't installed it yet, you can install it via npm:


`npm install -g yarn`

# 2. Creating a New Next.js 14 Project
Initialize the Project: Run the following command in your terminal to create a new Next.js project:

`npx create-next-app@latest my-nextjs13-app`
`Replace my-nextjs13-app with your desired project name.`

Navigate to Your Project Directory:

`cd my-nextjs13-app`
